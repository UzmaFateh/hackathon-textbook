# Technical Book on AI-Native Software Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy
All technical concepts must be verified against official documentation. This ensures that every code example, explanation, and concept presented in the book is accurate and aligns with current best practices and official resources.

### Clarity
Content must be accessible to developers and CS students. All explanations, examples, and concepts must be presented in a way that is understandable to the target audience without sacrificing technical precision.

### Practicality
Focus on reproducible code examples and real-world workflows. Every technical concept should be demonstrated with practical examples that readers can reproduce and apply in real-world scenarios.

### Documentation Standards
Use Docusaurus Markdown features (admonitions, code blocks) for all content. Citations must follow APA style for all academic and primary sources. Maintain a Flesch-Kincaid Grade level of 10-12 for optimal readability.

### Originality and Quality
100% human-verified content with 0% plagiarism tolerance. All content must be original and properly attributed where sources are referenced. Code snippets must be fully functional and error-free.

## Content Constraints

Structure: Minimum 5 comprehensive chapters that cover AI-native software development concepts thoroughly.

Sources: Minimum 15 high-authority sources (50% peer-reviewed) to ensure academic rigor and credibility.

Tech Stack: Integration of Spec-Kit Plus for specification and Claude Code for implementation to demonstrate AI-native development workflows.

## Development Workflow

All content must pass fact-checking reviews before publication. Code examples must be tested and verified as functional. All work must align with the AI-native development lifecycle, incorporating modern AI-assisted development practices and tools.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and guidelines for this project. All contributions must comply with these principles. Amendments require documentation of the change, approval from project maintainers, and a migration plan for existing content.
